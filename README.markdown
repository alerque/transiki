Transiki is a wiki of transit data. Think of it as having the data behind Google Transit in the hands of an OpenStreetMap style community.

The currently very alpha code base is running at [transiki.org](http://transiki.org). The project is documented on the [transiki wiki](http://wiki.transiki.org) and discussed on the [transiki mailing list](http://lists.transiki.org). Also see the [transiki blog](http://blog.transiki.org).
